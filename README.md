# BattleShip

The game is currently not working as the mechanism that enables the AI to populate ships is currently capable of inputting incorrect values.


Ideally, the game will intialize when the start button is pushed. After this the player can make selections for ship deployments that are displayed in real time. After thie deployment the shooting phase begins, however this currently disabled due to the fact the populating mechanism isn't working.

August 4th Update.

The game is currently operational. Please be careful about assigning the default ship placement values as there are still some bugs regarding the call stack registering invalid ship placements if the sequence is done improperly. 

There is a slight memmory issue regarding the targeting of panels in X10 - but it doesn't seem to occur everytime.
